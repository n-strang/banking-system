This was one of many summer projects to keep my understanding of C++ fresh. I tried to give this 1-3 hours per day minimum until completion 


This is very far from done. Current roadmaps as follows (will change as I get more ideas):


Create admin ✅


Create user accounts ✅


program loops to do multiple functions ✅


View accounts in an array ✅


add accounts to array ✅


delete accounts from array ❌


account details save to external file ❌


edit admin/user account details like pword/name/pin/bal ❌
